Q1 . Explain what the simple List component does

The simple List component is a React component that displays a list of items and is composed of two sub-components: SingleListItem and WrappedListComponent. It uses the SingleListItem component to display each item in the list. The isSelected property of the SingleListItem component is used to highlight the currently selected item in the list.

It accepts four props:
index: a number that represents the index of the item in the list.
isSelected: a boolean value that tells whether the item is currently selected or not.
onClickHandler: a function that is called when the list item is clicked.
text: a string that represents the text content of the item.

The SingleListItem component renders a list item with a background color that is either green or red depending on whether the item is selected or not. When the item is clicked, it turns green.

The WrappedListComponent accepts one prop:
items: an array of objects that represent the items in the list. Each object should have a 'text' property that contains the text content of the item.

Q2. What problems / warnings are there with code?

In the WrappedSingleListItem component, the onClickHandler is being called immediately instead of being passed as a function to be called later when the item is clicked. This means that the click handler will be called on every render of the component, which is not what we want.

The propTypes for the items prop in the WrappedListComponent component are incorrect. The array should be defined using PropTypes.arrayOf, and the shape of each object should be defined using PropTypes.shape.

In the WrappedListComponent component, the initial value for the selectedIndex state variable is undefined, but it should be null.

In the SingleListItem component, the isSelected prop is an index value, but it should be passed a boolean value if the index of the current item is equal to the selected item.

In the WrappedListComponent component, the default value for the items prop is set to null, but it should be an empty array instead or an array of objects.

The useState() syntax was incorrect in the code, it should be like this: const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(null); instead of: const [setSelectedIndex, selectedIndex] = useState();

Q3. Please fix, optimize, and/or modify the component as much as you think is necessary.

import React, { useState, useEffect, memo } from "react";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

// Single List Item
const WrappedSingleListItem = ({ index, isSelected, onClickHandler, text }) => {
  return (
    <li
      style={{
        backgroundColor: isSelected ? "green" : "red",
      }}
      onClick={() => onClickHandler(index)} // changed
    >
      {text}
    </li>
  );
};

WrappedSingleListItem.propTypes = {
  index: PropTypes.number,
  isSelected: PropTypes.bool,
  onClickHandler: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  text: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};

const SingleListItem = memo(WrappedSingleListItem);

// List Component
const WrappedListComponent = ({ items }) => {
  // error in below line, the syntax of useState is Wrong and no initialization was done
  // const [setSelectedIndex, selectedIndex] = useState();
  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(null); // changed

  useEffect(() => {
    setSelectedIndex(null);
  }, [items]);

  const handleClick = (index) => {
    setSelectedIndex(index);
  };

  return (
    <ul style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <SingleListItem
          key={index}
          onClickHandler={() => handleClick(index)}
          text={item.text}
          index={index}
          isSelected={selectedIndex === index} // changed
        />
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

WrappedListComponent.propTypes = {
  items: PropTypes.arrayOf(
    // changed
    PropTypes.shape({
      text: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    })
  ),
};

WrappedListComponent.defaultProps = {
  items: [
    // put values
    { text: "FrontEnd is the Best" },
    { text: "BackEnd is the Best" },
    { text: "Data Engineer is the Best" },
  ],
};

const List = memo(WrappedListComponent);

export default List;
